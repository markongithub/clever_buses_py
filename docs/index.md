The New York State Fair. Pardon me. [The GREAT New York State Fair](https://nysfair.ny.gov/). It's great.

Centro provides [bus service to the fair](https://www.centro.org/service_schedules/ny-state-fair) from three locations around Onondaga County: the Centro hub in downtown Syracuse, Destiny USA, and Long Branch Park. Their site provides start and end times for the service, but no specific timetable or promises of frequency.

Real-time arrival information for the buses is available on [Centro's Bus Time site](https://bus-time.centro.org/bustime/eta/eta.jsp?agency=All&route=SY901&direction=LOOP&stop=Hub%20Warren%20St&id=18106&showAllBusses=on). I scraped that site 

Here is a list of buses that did things.
